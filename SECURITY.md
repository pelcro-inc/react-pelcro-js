## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not open GitHub issues or pull requests - this makes the problem immediately visible to everyone, including malicious actors.

Security issues can be safely reported by email at security@pelcro.com. Pelcro's security team will triage your report and respond according to its impact on Pelcro clients, end-users and systems.
